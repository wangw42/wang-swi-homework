# 第七次作业

## Program with machine language according to the following c.<br>
**int_8 a = 1;**<br>
**int_8 c = a + 3;**

1) Write your assembly code & machine code
> LOD # 1<br>STO a <br> LOD a <br> ADD#3 <br> STO c <br> HLT

2) Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cyclye 
> Main Memory -> <br>Fetch Cycle<br>(Fetch Instruction -> Decode instruction) -> <br>Registers -> <br>Execution Cycle<br>(Get data -> Execute the instruction) -> <br>Main Memory

3) Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU
> **IR**: 指令寄存器，用来保存当前正在执行的一条指令 <br>
**PC**: 程序计数器，存放下一条指令在内存中的地址 <br>
**ACC**: 累加寄存器，功能是当运算器的算术逻辑单元(ALU)执行全部算术和逻辑运算时，为ALU提供一个工作区，暂时存放ALU运算结果<br>

4) Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine


## 简答题 

1) What are stored in memory?
> data & instructions

2) Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?
> yes

3) Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.
> eg. 0 0 0 X Z Z Z Z &nbsp;&nbsp; b b  b b b b b b <br>
前八位是命令指示(The 8-bit instruction specifier)，第四位为寻址模式，1表示操作数是数值，0表示操作数是该地址的内容；ZZZZ为操作码。<br>
后八位称为操作数(The 8-bit operand specifier)，表示一个数值或一个内存地址。


## 解释以下词汇

1) [汇编语言(Assembly Language)](_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)
>An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

2) [编译(Compiler)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler)
>A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

3) [命令式语言(Imperative programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)
>In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

4) [函数编程语言(Functional programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.

5) [过程式编程(Procedural programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)
>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC. Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.
