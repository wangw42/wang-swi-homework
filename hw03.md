## __使用维基百科，解释以下概念__
1. **Method of complements:**<br>
*In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.*<br>

    *Complement numbers on an adding machine c. 1910. <br>*

2. **Byte:**<br>
*The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.*<br>
3. **Integer(computer science):**<br>
*In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.*<br>
4. **Floating point:**<br>
*In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.*

### 仔细阅读"[Method of complements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_complements)"的内容。
你将注意到nines' complement in the decimal 和 ones' complement in binary等概念.<br>
1. 请证明：二进制的负数（two's complement of X）等于X的ones' complement + 1 (即X每位求反加1)。<br><br>
        The radix complement of an n digit number y in radix b is, by definition, $ b^n-y $. The radix complement is most easily obtained by adding 1 to the diminished radix complement, which is $ (b^n-1)-y $. Since  $ (b^n-1) $ is the digit (b-1) repeated n times (because $ b^n-1=(b-1)(b^{n-1}+b^{n-2}+...+b+1)=(b-1)b^{n-1}+...+(b-1)$; see also Geometric series Formula), the diminished radix complement of a number is found by complementing each digit with respect to b-1 (that is, subtracting each digit in y from b-1).
        The subtraction of y from x may be performed as follows. Adding the diminished radix complement of x to y results in the value $ b^{n}-1-x+y $ or $ b^{n}-1-(x-y) $ which is the diminished radix complement of x-y, except for possible padding digits b-1. The diminished radix complement of this is the value x-y. Alternatively, adding the radix complement of y to x results in the value $ x+b^{n}-y $ or $ x-y+b^{n} $. Assuming y ≤ x , the result will always be greater or equal to $ b^n $ and dropping the initial '1' is the same as subtracting $ b^n $, making the result $ x-y+b^{n}-b^{n} $ or just $ x-y $, the desired result.<br><br>
2. Int8_t x = -017; 请用八进制描述变量x。在c中017即$\(017)_8 $ 。<br>
         $$ x = (-017)_8 = -(1*8^1+7*8^0) $$ 

### 阅读维基百科"[Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement)" 的内容，特别是Sign extension小节内容。<br>
1. C程序：int8_t x = -0x1f; int y = x; 请用16进制描述变量x和y，并说明int y＝x的计算过程。<br>
         $$ x = -(1*16^1+15*16^0) $$ <br>
         y = x 

2. 请用数学证明，为什么可以这么计算。<br>
         Given a set of all possible N-bit values, we can assign the lower (by the binary value) half to be the integers from 0 to $ (2^N − 1 − 1) $ inclusive and the upper half to be $ −2^N − 1 $ to −1 inclusive. The upper half (again, by the binary value) can be used to represent negative integers from $ −2^N − 1 $ to −1 because, under addition modulo $ 2^N $ they behave the same way as those negative integers. That is to say that because i + j mod $ 2^N = i + (j + 2^N) $ mod $ 2^N $ any value in the set { $ j + k 2^N $| k is an integer }  can be used in place of j.

1. NaN是什么？<br>
         In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities.
